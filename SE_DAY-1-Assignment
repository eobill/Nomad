PART 1.

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the development, operation, and maintenance of software. It involves a structured approach to designing, creating, testing, and maintaining software applications to ensure they are reliable, efficient, and scalable.
    Importance.
 Software engineering drives technological innovation by enabling the creation of new applications, products, and services. 
 Proper software engineering practices ensure that software is reliable and stable, reducing the likelihood of crashes, errors, and system failures.
Well-engineered software is optimised for performance and efficiency.
Software engineering principles facilitate the development of scalable software that can grow with increasing demands.
By following systematic processes, software engineering helps in reducing development costs and minimising the time required to bring products to market.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The introduction of high-level programming languages like Fortran, COBOL, and LISP revolutionised software development. These languages made coding more accessible and efficient by allowing programmers to write instructions in a more human-readable form, rather than in machine code.This milestone significantly reduced the complexity of programming and paved the way for more sophisticated software applications.
Structured programming introduced a disciplined approach to coding, emphasising the use of control structures such as loops, conditionals, and subroutines. This methodology improved code readability, maintainability, and reliability. It also laid the foundation for modern programming practices and languages, such as C and Pascal.
Agile methodologies, including Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP), emerged as a response to the limitations of traditional, linear development models like Waterfall. Agile promotes iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility, allowing teams to adapt to changing requirements and deliver software more efficiently. This approach has become a cornerstone of modern software engineering, enabling faster and more responsive development cycles.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning & Analysis. In this initial phase, the project’s feasibility is evaluated, and business requirements are gathered from stakeholders. This phase involves defining the project’s scope, objectives, and potential risks.
Requirements Definition. This phase translates the gathered information into detailed requirements. It involves specifying what the software should do, including functional and non-functional requirements.
Design. During the design phase, the software’s architecture is created. This includes designing the system’s overall structure, user interfaces, and data models. The goal is to create a blueprint for the development team to follow.
Development. In this phase, the actual coding takes place. Developers write the code based on the design specifications. This phase often involves multiple iterations and collaboration among team members.
Testing. Testing is crucial to ensure the software functions correctly and meets the specified requirements. This phase includes various types of testing, such as unit testing, integration testing, and system testing. 
Deployment. Once the software has been tested and approved, it is deployed to the production environment. This phase may involve installation, configuration, and user training. 
Maintenance. After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase. This involves fixing bugs, making updates, and adding new features as needed. Maintenance ensures the software remains functional and relevant over time.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall model is a linear sequential development process, where each phase must be completed before the next begins. It's often likened to a waterfall, as progress flows steadily downward.Key characteristics are ; Sequential phases: Requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Rigid: Once a phase is complete, it's difficult to make changes. Predictable: Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements and a stable scope.
e.g Developing software for a medical device where regulatory compliance is critical. The requirements are clear, and changes are minimal once development starts.
 Agile methodologies emphasise iterative development, flexibility, and customer collaboration. They focus on delivering working software frequently and adapting to changing requirements. Key characteristics are; Iterative development: Project is divided into smaller iterations, or sprints. Flexibility: Can adapt to changes throughout the development process. Customer collaboration: Frequent interaction with stakeholders to ensure the product meets their needs.
e.g Creating a mobile app for a startup where user feedback is crucial. The requirements may change based on user testing and market trends.
